Do you have an idea for an event you'd like to see us run?

Or want to suggest some different topic you'd like to see covered in out talks
and workshops?

We try to maintain a fairly even balance of talks, workshops, discussions, etc.
covering a wide range of topics that are relevant to the work that happens on
site, with that in mind we are very open to suggestions from the community to
distribute knowledge and encourage collaboration as much as possible.
